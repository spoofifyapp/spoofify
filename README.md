# Spoofify [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/spoofifyapp/spoofify.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/spoofifyapp/spoofify)

**Don't let apps steel your data! Get to know your Android smartphone.**

---

## What is Spoofify?

Spoofify is an Android demo app for permission based data piracy. With every single app installation you'll have to confirm that the installed app will have certain permissions. But did you ever think about what each permission does really allow?

Spoofify illustrates how easily private data can be accessed and stolen from your Android smartphone.

## How to contribute?

As Spoofify is developed as open source, we need some help to kickstart our project. Here are some possibilities:

  - Open an issue for bugfixing or a feature request
  - Fork the repo and send us a pull request
  - Watch our [project backlog](https://trello.com/spoofifyapp) andâ€¦ 
  	- vote for your favorite feature requests
  	- [contact us](http://spoofifyapp.org/contact/) to request a new feature
  	- request an invite for the development board to
  		- Discuss for technical implementation questions
  		- Vote for next iteration tasks
  - Translate and verify the [localization](https://github.com/spoofifyapp/spoofify-localization) (l10n) for common used languages (English, German, French, ...)
  - Feel free to [contact us](http://spoofifyapp.org/contact/)

### Please take care of our coding conventions:

  - Use 2 spaces for indents (no tabs)
    - If using Sublime Text 2, just use the project files in the `sublimetext` dir to automatically code with this convention! :)
  - Use English language for variables, comments and function names
  - Comment every <del>non-elementary</del> <ins>single</ins> set of instructions (so it's much easier to read and edit the code)
  - Use the [Wiki](https://github.com/spoofifyapp/spoofify/wiki) for additional documentation purposes
  - Take care of our API (also in our [Wiki](https://github.com/spoofifyapp/spoofify/wiki))
